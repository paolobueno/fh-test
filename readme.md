Description
---
This repository contains answers to the questions of the test on [questions.md](questions.md), and the a technical test, chosen to be the questions in **Option 2**. The following section contains instructions on how to run the solution.

Dependencies and Running
---
The solution requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) as the environment to run, and the [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm) test runner in order to run its tests.

The solutions to questions **1** and **2** are shown within the respective tests inside the `spec/` directory, and the solution to question 3 is observable by running the module through `node q3`, however the implementation utilizes the `lib/backoff` module which addresses the actual challenge proposed by the exercise.

Both modules under the `lib/` directory are properly tested and contain [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org/) for the exposed methods.
